`Organizable` is an API client built upon Javascript that helps you organize and keep track of your projects 🔆.

`Organizable` lets you handle sets of boards, each of which includes multiple lists, which in turn contain sets of cards. 

This single-page web app was developed as part of an extended project of [Codeable](https://github.com/codeableorg) web-development bootcamp. It was specifically the final evaluation of the Javascript module 💻.
